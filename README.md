<li> Now I  am adding project features---</li>
<li>If you click button , course name  will store in cart .
One course you can  select just one time.</li>

<li>when you store a course then credit time will show in cart
and if you store another course then it show total credit time 
and it will show your remaining time.</li>

<li>you can load max 20 credit time .When credit fill up you cant add more course and it will show your remaining time null. </li>
 
<li>If you select multiple course  it show your total price.</li>

<li>When remaining time is null and credit time fill up it gives a  alert.</li>
Besides When you   select One course name  more then one times it give you a alert.</li>

<li>Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.</li>
<li>Firstly I added  2 Components my  app.jsx.There are a component its called Blogs.jsx.I used here total five state.Now I want to discuss how can I manage state .<li>

<li>First I used blogs and setBlogs for a state .I used it because I need a useEffect for call my api data.Then I used map for show  card dynamically, there are ( image,title,credit-time,price). here I set a value ,and make it  a prop for another components .Then I called my api data easily.<li>

<li>I used a state that we can called values and setValues.Firstly I used it for get course name and can store.It used it by a function we can call it a handler .Here we set out state value  in object.I make it a props Where we use map and make a link for two components (blogs.jsx and blog.jsx)  .and I called it by a Button .Then  our result is ok . <li>

<li>I use another 3 state .There are same and i used same process.
Just different is the value is increasing and  decreasing.I used it same function there I used my first and second state because I used same button.
Firstly I set value  and set other value  so that new value are   changing.Now I used it props For Card.jsx .Then It work properly<li>

<li>Thank You </li>
